Page 543 : _Therefore, as one step to further
improve the public accessibility of
charge information, effective January 1,
2019, we announced the update to our
guidelines to require hospitals to make
available a list of their current standard
charges via the internet in a machine
readable format and to update this
information at least annually, or more
often as appropriate. This could be in
the form of the chargemaster itself or
another form of the hospitalâ€™s choice, as
long as the information is in machine
readable format_
